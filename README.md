# TEXT_Summarization_threads

**Thread Parallelism**
[The core of this project is the implementation of multi-threading. By dividing the summarization process into multiple threads, the application can handle multiple chunks of text simultaneously, significantly reducing processing time.]

**Extractive Summarization:** 
The summarization technique employed here is extractive summarization. It involves identifying the most important sentences or phrases from the original text to create a concise and coherent summary.

**Resource Efficiency:** 
With thread parallelism, the application maximizes CPU resources, efficiently utilizing available cores for faster processing. This ensures that the summarization task can be completed swiftly, even for lengthy documents.

**User-friendly Interface:** 
The project provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their text for summarization. The summarized output is presented in a clear and organized format.



How it Works
Input Text: Users provide the input text that needs to be summarized through the interface.

**Thread Allocation:**
[The application allocates multiple threads to process different sections of the text simultaneously. This significantly speeds up the summarization process.]

**Summarization Algorithm: **
[The text is analyzed using an extractive summarization algorithm. The algorithm ranks sentences based on their importance and selects the top-ranking sentences for the summary.]

**Thread Synchronization:** [The application ensures proper synchronization among threads to compile the summarized content coherently.]

**Output Summary:** [The summarized content is presented as the output, providing users with a concise and meaningful summary of the input text.]
