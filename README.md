# TEXT_Summarization_webscraping_multiple


How it Works
Input Text: Users provide the input text that needs to be summarized through the interface.

**Thread Allocation:**
[The application allocates multiple threads to process different s of the URL's simultaneously. This significantly speeds up the summarization process.]

**Summarization Algorithm: **
[The text is analyzed using an extractive summarization algorithm. The algorithm ranks sentences based on their importance and selects the top-ranking sentences for the summary.]

**Thread Synchronization:** [The application ensures proper synchronization among threads to compile the summarized content coherently.]

**Output Summary:** [The summarized content is presented as the output, providing users with a concise and meaningful summary of the input text.]
